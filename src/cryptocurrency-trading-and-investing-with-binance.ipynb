    "## Stop loss order\n",
    "\n",
    "Limit orders are placed to `grab` profit. You may want to set one of these against a `market` order,\n",
    "One order you will definitely want to place against a `market` order is a `stop loss` order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we bought Bitcoin at around 37k EUR - We can place a `stop loss` at say 35k EUR.\n",
    "We select the `Stop-limit` tab and enter a price of 35k EUR for the `stop`.\n",
    "However, the `stop` is just the trigger; once this price is reached, we need a `limit` order to be placed to actually sell the Bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "And very important; for a `sell stop loss` we need the price to be slightly below the `stop` price.\n",
    "What if we don't, and we place the `limit` at the same price as the `stop`?\n",
    "Well, if prices are moving rapidly, the `limit` triggered by the `stop` of a same price of 35k EUR takes a finite amount of time to be placed.\n",
    "While the `limit` is being placed, the price may already be below the `stop` and so the `limit` will miss execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Stop loss](../docs/images/stop-loss.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moral of the story is set the `limit` order lower than the `stop` order (and vice versa when you have `sold` and wish to hedge against the price rising)."
