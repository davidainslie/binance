    "- Promise to convert 1 USDT back to $1 at any time (Trust).\n",
    "- Value/price is pegged to the underlying collateral ($1).\n",
    "- Stable price (close to zero price fluctuations).\n",
    "- 1 USDT == $1.000\n",
    "- Tether issued and managed by private company - Controvery about USD backing (backing irregularities, not audited).\n",

    "- Tether (USDT); True USD (TUSD); USD Coin (USDC); Binance USD (BUSD).\n",

    "- Sometimes, direct trades between fiat money and cyptos (Bitcoin) are not allowed; or expensive; and/or slow.\n",
    "- Trades between stable coins and cryptos can be cheaper, faster, and more convenient (staying in the crypto world).\n",

    "\n",
    "- High volatility (high returns).\n",
    "- Highly liquid (Bitcoin, Ethereum).\n",

    "- Not controlled/manipulated by authorities.\n",
    "- Limited supply.\n",
    "- Trading 24/7.\n",
    "- Low barriers to start trading/investing.\n",
    "- Derivative trading (Futures, Options, CFDs).\n",
    "- Long term trend and price appreciation (maybe / hopefully).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why `not` trade/invest in cryptos?\n",
    "- High volatility (high losses).\n",
    "- Prices can easily be influenced/manipulated (e.g. a single tweet from Elon Musk).\n",
    "- Wallets and Exchanges frequently hacked.\n",
    "- Scam websites and criminal use.\n",
    "- Complexity (blockchain).\n",
    "- Not regulated by authorities (exposed to market forces, can be difficult to stabilise).\n",
    "- Regulatory environment in flux (services/products and regulatory requirements can rapidly change).\n",
    "- Long term trend and price appreciation (will the bubble burst?)."

    "> Spot trading involves directly purchasing or selling financial instruments and assets such as cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, or bonds. Delivery of the asset is often immediately.\n",

    "> Derivatives are financial instruments, set between two or more parties, that derive their value from an underlying asset, group of assets, or benchmark.\n",
    "> It's a `bet` on the future price movement of an asset (highly speculative).\n",
    "> Trader will (typically) never become the `owner` of the underlying asset (unlike spot).\n",
    "> Trader doesn't pay a price - She needs to post margin to collateralise (potential) cash settlement obligations.\n",
    "> Margin requirement is typically (much) less than the price of the underlying - Trading with leverage.\n",
    "> Trader can benefit from rising and falling prices of the underlying asset (for spot, there is also short selling)."
